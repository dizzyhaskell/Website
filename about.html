        <h1 class="white">ABOUT US</h1>

        <H3 class="white">Concept racing Community started in late 2019. Owner and Head admin, James Haskell along with admins, James Bartrop, Edward Blackmore, Ashley Bentley and Chris Bromley, put together a small group on facebook. This quickly snowballed into discord and then just as Covid 19 struck in early 2020 CRS began its journey as a Sim Racing Championship Provider. The Community has since crowned many 1 time and Multiple time season champions and has agreat and rich history for promoting great wheel to wheel racing.<br><br>

        The community aims to continue on with its moderately successful series on both PC and Xbox. But shortly CRS will bring back "CRS Track Days" and the Classic "Crs Time Attack Series "
